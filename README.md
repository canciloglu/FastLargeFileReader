#Fast Large File Readers for C++ and Java

Sample test codes for reading huge plain text files in C++ and Java to measure if one of those languages provides faster processing (to test common belief that C++ performance is better than Java). 

##Test Codes
There are two reader implementations in the repository for each language (under java and cpp folders) - regular/common one and fast/efficient one.

Benchmark tests have been run on the same Macbook Pro which has Intel Core i7 2 GHz Cpu, 8 GB 1600 MHz RAM, SSD storage (so file I/O is really fast).

##Test Results
Coming soon...
